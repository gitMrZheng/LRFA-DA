# Learning Robust Features Alignment for Cross Domain Medical Image Analysis via Dual Consistency Regularizations
We provide skin disease datasets and COVID-19 datasets for domain adaptation from dermatoscopy to smartphones, and from typical pneumonia to COVID-19.
## Dataset
Skin diseases classification: ISIC dataset, HAM10000 dataset and PAD-UFES-20 dataset. We collected and integrated the following open-source datasets on skin diseases:
